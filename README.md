# jam's dotfiles

hi im jam, and i need easy access to these dotfiles so they are plug and play.

## Installation

Run the setup.sh script that creates a symbolic link with the files in this directory
NOTE: the script assumes that the jam-configfiles is in the home directory

## TODO
- the plugins are git repos, so the files in the submodules are not uploaded. work on getting the files uploaded
